                  <h3>Trafalgar Gets Innovative in Europe, Britain</h3>
                  <article>Trafalgar has launched its 2015 Europe and Britain program featuring a record 117 carefully crafted itineraries with 14 new trips, across 10 trip styles and covering 44 countries.
					 With more than 600 Insider Experiences, Trafalgar gives travellers an authentic insight into the culture of each destination. The Hidden Journeys collection is a new trip style which
					 takes clients to less-visited places such as the Dordogne and Bordeaux regions in France with smaller, intimate groups of up to 26 guests. To make it easier for agents selling to solo
					 travellers, Trafalgar has decreased its single supplement from 50-100% on multiple departure dates of 12 holidays (including all of Egypt) in 2015.
